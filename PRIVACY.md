# Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 16, 2026

## Overview

Codex Discord Presence is designed to display Codex activity in Discord through local Discord Rich Presence communication.

## Information Processed Locally

The Plugin may read the following information locally to prepare a Rich Presence status:

- The current workspace or project name, when project display is enabled.
- Plugin configuration and process state, including a process ID and diagnostic log.
- When task-title display is enabled, the active Codex task title or a locally configured title override.

This information is processed on your device by the Plugin. Full project paths, prompts, conversation content, source files, and project contents are not used for the Presence status.

## Information Shared with Discord

When Discord Rich Presence is active, the Plugin sends the configured status details, state, timestamps, and optional button metadata to the Discord desktop client over its local IPC connection. If task-title display is enabled, the selected title becomes the status state. Discord then handles that presence according to its own policies and settings.

Do not enable project names or repository buttons if they could reveal confidential information.

## Data Collection and Storage

The Plugin does not operate a remote service, collect analytics, create user accounts, or transmit data to the Plugin authors. Its local process state and logs are stored in the Plugin's managed data directory and are removed when the Plugin is uninstalled from its final scope, unless you preserve them separately.

## Third-Party Services

Your use of Codex and Discord is governed by their respective privacy policies. The Plugin cannot control how those services process information once it is provided to them.

## Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated by publishing a revised version in this repository. Continued use of the Plugin after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
